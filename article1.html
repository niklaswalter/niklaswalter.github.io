    <p>
      The heat equation is a fundamental partial differential equation in physics and mathematics. It describes the diffusion of heat in a solid medium over time. The one-dimensional heat equation is given by:
    </p>

    <p>
      $$\frac{{\partial u}}{{\partial t}} = k \frac{{\partial^2 u}}{{\partial x^2}}$$
    </p>

    <p>
      where \( u \) represents the temperature distribution in the solid, \( t \) is time, \( x \) is the spatial coordinate, and \( k \) is the thermal diffusivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      This equation can be solved using various methods, such as separation of variables or Fourier series expansions.
