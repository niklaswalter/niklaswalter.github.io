<div class="article-container">

The heat equation is a fundamental partial differential equation in physics and mathematics. It describes the diffusion of heat in a solid medium over time. The one-dimensional heat equation is given by:

$$
\frac{{\partial u}}{{\partial t}} = k \frac{{\partial^2 u}}{{\partial x^2}}
$$

where \( u \) represents the temperature distribution in the solid, \( t \) is time, \( x \) is the spatial coordinate, and \( k \) is the thermal diffusivity.

This equation can be solved using various methods, such as separation of variables or Fourier series expansions.
